## Project desciption
An example of using the Adafruit FT232H Breakout PCB to communicate between a PC and MCP3208 over SPI. Additionally, a Python application was developed to control the MCP3208 from a computer and visualize the data on a live graph.

MCP3208
=======
The MCP3208 is an 8-channel, 12-bit ADC chip. It offers two modes for ADC measurement. You can choose between using the analog input channels configured as single-ended inputs or as differential inputs.
